# Attabot 2.0 - Didactic Robot for Robotics Education

Attabot 2.0 is an open-source didactic robot designed to introduce practical knowledge to students who will one day occupy robotics positions. The project aims to provide a platform for students about sensors, integration of components, and simulation systems such as ROS ("Robot Operating System").

## Features

The Attabot 2.0 project includes the following features:

- Drive system for locomotion
- Range of sensors for environment perception, including sonar and IR sensor
- Open-source 3D CAD and STL files for the robot design
- Arduino and ESP32 communication for control and data acquisition
- ESP32 for wireless connection to a MQTT broker
- Integration with ROS (”Robot Operating System”) for simulation and control

The robot has been designed to be easy to use, with a user-friendly interface for programming and controlling the robot. Attabot 2.0 is also modular, allowing for easy customization and expansion.
