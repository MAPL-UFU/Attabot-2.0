# Arduino ROS VL53L0X Laser Sensor Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to use an Arduino board with a VL53L0X Laser Sensor to publish distance measurement data to a ROS (Robot Operating System) topic.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- An Arduino board with the required hardware components (VL53L0X sensor, wires, etc.).
- ROS (Robot Operating System) installed on your Linux machine.

## Setup

1. **Arduino Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board. This code interfaces with the VL53L0X sensor and publishes distance measurement data to a ROS topic. Ensure the following connections:

    **VL53L0X Sensor PINOUT**:

    - GND: GND
    - VCC: 5V
    - SDA: Connect to Arduino's SDA
    - SCL: Connect to Arduino's SCL

2. **ROS Core**: Start the ROS core by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    roscore
    ```

3. **ROS Serial Node**: Run the ROS serial node to establish communication between your Arduino and ROS. Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with the correct port if needed, and set the baud rate to match your Arduino code (default is 57600):

    ```bash
    rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0 _baud:=57600
    ```

4. **List ROS Topics**: To verify that the `vl53l0x_scan` topic is being published, run:

    ```bash
    rostopic list
    ```

    You should see `vl53l0x_scan` in the list of topics.

5. **Visualize Data with RViz**:
    - Open RViz by running `rviz` in your terminal.
    - In RViz, set the global frame to 'laser':
        - Click on "Global Options" on the left panel.
        - Under "Fixed Frame," select "laser" from the dropdown menu.
    - Create a LaserScan element:
        - Click on "Add" in the top panel.
        - Select "By topic" and choose the `/vl53l0x_scan` topic.
    - Use the topic name (`/vl53l0x_scan`) for visualization. You should now see the laser scan data in RViz.

6. **Customization**: You can customize the behavior of the Arduino code by adjusting parameters such as the number of readings, angle ranges, and range values in the code.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues, make sure that your Arduino board is properly connected to your computer, and the Arduino code is successfully uploaded.
- Double-check the I2C connections and wiring to the VL53L0X sensor.
- Ensure that ROS is correctly installed and the core (`roscore`) is running.

## Conclusion

This tutorial explains how to use an Arduino with a VL53L0X Laser Sensor to publish distance measurement data to a ROS topic. You can now integrate this functionality into your robotics projects or explore further ROS capabilities.
